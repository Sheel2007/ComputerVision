# Computer Vision
This is a repository of all my computer vision projects.

All these projects can be run in either jupyter notebook or a virtual environment.

The projects each have a corresponding xml file that can be downloaded from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades. 

All the xml files have been downloaded by myself and are NOT created by me.

Feel free to download any and all of these projects.
